## 5. Work Schedule

At REAK INFOTECH LLP, we understand the importance of a structured work schedule to maintain efficiency, collaboration, and client satisfaction. This section outlines our standard work schedule and expectations for attendance and punctuality.

### Standard Work Schedule

Our standard work schedule is Monday through Friday, from 10:00 AM to 7:30 PM. This schedule may vary based on the specific needs of your role and project deadlines. Your immediate supervisor or manager will communicate any variations to your work schedule in advance.

#### Break Periods

We encourage all employees to take regular breaks to rest and recharge. Break periods are typically scheduled as follows:

    Lunch Break: 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM
    Evening Break: 5:00 PM - 5:30 PM

Please note that the duration of breaks may vary based on your specific role and responsibilities. Feel free to communicate with your supervisor if you require any adjustments to your break schedule.

#### Attendance and Punctuality

Consistent attendance and punctuality are essential to maintain the productivity and teamwork necessary for our success. If you are unable to adhere to your work schedule due to illness, emergencies, or other unforeseen circumstances, please follow these steps:

- Notify Your Supervisor: Contact your immediate supervisor or manager as early as possible to inform them of your absence or delay.

- Urgent leaves are limited, they are 20% of your casual leave allottment and can be used as emergency/urgent leaves. A leave is considered an urgent / emergency leave when the application is not submitted (X) business days before, X being number of leaves you're applying for. 

- Leaves must be applied through https://manage.reak.in, or through email if portal is unavailable. Casual leaves have to be submitted X business days before, X being the number of days you're applying leave for.

- In some cases, you may be required to make up missed time to fulfill your work responsibilities. Discuss this with your supervisor. This could mean working overtime or working holidays.

- Provide appropriate documentation, such as a doctor's note, if your absence is due to medical reasons (Sick Leaves).

Employees arriving later than 10:30 AM in the morning or missing the stand-up call while WFH will result in a half-day leave if occurred more than 3 days a month.

At the end of month we will be compiling hours worked based on attendance data, The expectation is to have 45-48 hours work week on average. For record keeping login times either remotely or in-person after 10:15 will be considered late entry.

#### Remote Work and Flexibility

We recognize the importance of work-life balance and understand that certain roles may allow for remote work or flexible hours. Any remote work or flexible arrangements must be discussed and approved by your supervisor or manager and should align with the needs of your team and projects.

WFH - Work From Home is allowed for 2 days a week at maximum (incl. Holidays), If you wish to extend the period contact your immediate manager / lead with an email.

Remote Working - Working from Home for more than 2 days a week either once or recurring will be termed as Remote Working. It's not possible to transition from Remote Working <-> In-Office. You need explicit approval from your manager / lead regarding this.

Remote Working unlocks a few more challenges in times like this where data security is a big concern as well as performance and collaboration.

Hence in order to qualify for Remote Work the following conditions must be met :
- Permission from Manager / Lead for the time period
- VPN Setup on Personal Device
- Remote workstation credentials
- Broadband Internet

Remote working on personal devices is an absolute no-no and can be grounds for termination.

Video and Audio are compulsary for any calls / meetings while on WFH or Remote Work.

#### Overtime and Additional Hours

Judging overtime for developers is indeed a very difficult task, as it could be entirely developer's fault for not meeting software deadline and consequently the need to crunch and churn additional hours.

We therefore have implemented the following, any additional hours worked over months will convert into casual leave allottments in multiples of 9.5 over the govt prescribed limit of 48 hours in a week average.

## 6. Attendance and Punctuality

Attendance and Punctuality play an important role in creating a better working atmosphere for all, We do allow flexible hours if you're independently working on your tasks.

But working on a collaborative environment requires setting boundaries and hence the need for attendance and punctuality to achieve a common goal.
